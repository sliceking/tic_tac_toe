Tic Tac Toe

Is a classic paper-and-pencil game where two players take turns marking their spaces in a 3 X 3 grid.  If a player
succeeds placing three of their marks in in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, they win the game.

In the Friendly House version, players can choose a 3x3 grid or 5x5 grid.  They have the ability to choose between 8
 Nintendo Characters from the following games:
1) Battletoads
2) Contra
3) Duck-Hunt
4) Punch-Out
5) Zelda
6) Super Mario Brothers
7) Mega Man
8) Metroid

They can also choose anarchy mode where a player can click on a space that was clicked by the opposing player.  That
player has a 65% chance of changing that space to that of their own character.  If they are unsuccessul, they lose a
turn.
